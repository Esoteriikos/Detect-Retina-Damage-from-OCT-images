Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross sections of the retinas of living patients.
Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time (Swanson and Fujimoto, 2017).

**(Far left)** choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with neovascular membrane (white arrowheads) and associated subretinal fluid (arrows).

**(Middle left)** Diabetic macular edema (DME) with retinal-thickening-associated intraretinal fluid (arrows).

**(Middle right)** Multiple drusen (arrowheads) present in early AMD.

**(Far right)** Normal retina with preserved foveal contour and absence of any retinal fluid/edema.
